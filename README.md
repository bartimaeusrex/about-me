## About Me
My name is Patrick Reinhart. I am originally from Colorado but am not a sports fan and have never been skiing. I previously worked as bookseller and developed a passion for researching antiquarian books, and collecting early 20th century/pre-Tolkien works of fantasy, among other things. I am also a graphic designer.

## For fun
* I play the tenor guitar
* I have illustrated two published children's picture books
* I once designed a series of four billboards with antique photos of dead people.
* Atari 2600 FTW
