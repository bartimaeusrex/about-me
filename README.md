## About Me
My name is Patrick Reinhart and I am originally from Colorado. I am a book enthusiast,
former book seller, and always collector. I am also a graphic designer, and web designer,
having taught myself HTML starting back in 1998 or so. 

## Fun facts?
I used do Irish dancing. I have illustrated two children's picture books.
I grew up in a city just outside Denver where we raised chickens, ducks,
geese, rabbits, the occasional toad, the odd rat, a few goats and a donkey.
