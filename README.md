"About Me" 
"My name is Patrick Reinhart and I am originally from Colorado. I am a book enthusiast, former book seller, and always collector. I am also a graphic designer, and web designer, having taught myself HTML starting back in 1998 or so." 
"Fun facts? I used do Irish dancing. I have illustrated two children's picture books. I grew up in a city just outside Denver where we raised chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, the occasional toad, the odd rat, a few goats and a donkey."
